                <h3>Neoadjuvant therapy:</h3>
                <p>In almost all patients with rectal cancer, the first treatments will be a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy.</p>
                <p>The exact sequence and duration to be determined based on your MRI. Radiotherapy usually given first and given over 5 days OR 5 weeks then chemotherapy for 4 months (every 2 weeks).</p>
                <p>However, this may be different based on your specific tumor.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content" data-subtopic="goals-of-treatment" style="display:none;">
                <h3>Goals of treatment:</h3>
                <p>The main goal of neoadjuvant therapy is to reduce
                    the risk of local recurrence (tumour coming back).
                    Studies have shown that this risk can be reduced by
                    50% in most patients. Other goals of this first
                    treatment are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduce tumour size</li>
                    <li>Reduce the risk of spread to other organs</li>
                    <li>Improve long term survival</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Importantly, this first treatment can result in complete clinical response in 40-50% of patients. In this case, surgery may be avoided.</p>
                <p>However, if the tumour doesn’t respond completely, then surgery is still required.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content" data-subtopic="radiotherapy" style="display:none;">
                <h3>Radiotherapy: Downsides</h3>
                <p>Radiotherapy can worsen your bowel habits both
                    during and right after treatment, as well as for the
                    rest of your life</p>
                <p>There is also a possible risk of worse sexual and
                    urinary function.</p>
                <p>If surgery is needed AFTER radiotherapy:</p>
                <p>There will be a higher risk of anastomotic leak (i.e., healing of your bowel connection). Because of this, your surgery will include a temporary stoma.</p>
                <p>The combination of surgery and radiotherapy will result in worse long-term bowel function.</p>

            <div class="content" data-subtopic="chemotherapy" style="display:none;">
                <h3>Chemotherapy: Downsides</h3>
                <p>Chemotherapy carries the risk of nerve damage
                    (burning, numbness, tingling in hands and feet
                    especially). This can be very bothersome and
                    really affects ability to work and do your normal
                    physical activities in a lot of patients.</p>
                <p>This happens in more than 2/3 of all patients who
                    get chemotherapy.</p>
                <p>This damage and its symptoms is permanent
                    damage in 1/3 of patients who get chemotherapy.</p>

                <p>There is a possibility that your tumour will response
                    fully (i.e., fully gone) after radiotherapy and
                    chemotherapy. This happens about 40-50% of the
                    time in patients who get a combination of
                    radiotherapy and chemotherapy as first treatment.</p>

                <p>In 1/3 of patients who have a clinical complete

                <p>In cases where the tumour does not respond fully to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, OR there is local tumor regrowth after initial complete clinical response, surgery to remove your rectum is needed.</p>
                <p>The exact type of surgery will mostly depend on the location of your tumor. Other factors that we take into consideration is your age, physical health, how your bowel habits are at the present time, as well as your own preferences.</p>
                <ol>There are two main options:
                    <li>If your tumor invades the sphincter muscles in your anus, then we will need to remove your rectum and anus, and give you a permanent colostomy (i.e., stoma bag made from your colon).</li>
                    <li>If your tumour does NOT invade your sphincter muscles, then we will still
                        remove your rectum, but a reconnection is usually possible (LINK TO BOX 7).
                        
                        In this case, you will still need a temporary stoma called a diverting loop
                        ileostomy (i.e., a stoma made from your small intestine).</li>

                <h3>Surgery - LAR:</h3>
                <p>A low anterior resection with diverting loop ileostomy is a surgery where we will remove your rectum, reconnect the intestines, and make a temporary stoma bag.</p>
                <p>This surgery can usually be done with the camera and small incisions (either laparoscopy or robot).</p>
                <p>We will make a temporary stoma bag as part of this surgery. This is to protect the anastomosis (i.e., bowel connection) that we will make during the surgery. You will need another surgery to eventually close the stoma,usually at least 3 months after surgery but can be longer depending on your healing, recovery, and if you need more treatments.</p>
                <p>It is important to know that your bowel movements once your stoma is closed will not be normal (LINK TO BOX 9). You will likely have many bowel movements with urgency and maybe even accidents. This can have a major negative impact on your activities, work, and quality of life.</p>

            <div class="content"  data-subtopic="hospital-stay">
                <h3>Hospital stay:</h3>
                <p>Patients usually stay in hospital for 2-3 days after this surgery.</p>
                <p>Recovery usually takes several weeks before you start regaining your energy.</p>
                <p>Usually patients feel almost fully recovered by 6-8 weeks after surgery.</p>

            <div class="content"  data-subtopic="surgical-risks">
                <h3>Surgical risks:</h3>
                <p>The main risk from this surgery is an anastomotic leak. This iswhen your connection does not heal fully, and a hole can develop. This usually happens in the first 1-2 weeks after surgery. The treatment for this will depend on the size of the hole that develops. Usually the negative impact of a leak is lower because of your temporary stoma bag (LINK TO BOX 11) that diverts your stool away from the connection and hole.</p>
                <p>About 30% of patients will have issues with their sexual and urinary function. This is because all of those nerves are exactly where we need to operate. These nerves are often too small to be seen and can be damaged during surgery.</p>
                <p>Once your stoma bag is closed eventually and you are passing stool from your anus again, it is important to know that your bowel movements will NOT be normal. The severity of these symptoms depends on how close the connection is to your anus (in other words, how much rectum we have to remove).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content"  data-subtopic="cancer-outcomes">
                <h3>Cancer outcomes:</h3>
                <p>The long-term cancer outcomes will depend on the exact stage of your cancer, its response to the chemotherapy and radiotherapy that you have already received, and the quality of surgery. Your cancer can either come back locally (i.e., in your pelvis) or as metastases (spread to other organs). The highest risk is in the first 2 years. Our team will continue to follow you closely to make sure that if your cancer comes back, we  catch it early. Your cancer follow-ups will include blood tests, scans, and endoscopy.</p>
                <p>Local recurrence: The risk of your cancer coming back in the same area is about 5-10% over the next 5 years. The highest risk is in the first 2 years. If your cancer does come back in the same place, the treatment will depend on whether it has also spread elsewhere, how big the recurrence is, and whether it touches any surrounding organs.</p>
                <p>Distant metastasis: Your cancer can also spread to other organs away from your intestines. For rectal cancer, the most likely organs of spread are your liver, lungs, and the lining of your abdomen. The risk of distant spread will depend on certain tumour characteristics, the response to therapy and final pathology.

                    <ul>
                        <li>In general, the risk of spreading to other organs is about 10-25% for stage I-II, and 25-40% for stage III.</li>
                        <li>Usually, the treatment for metastases is chemotherapy.</li>

                <h3>Surgery - APR:</h3>
                <p>An abdominoperineal resection is a type of surgery that will remove your rectum and
                    create of a permanent stoma from your colon (called a colostomy). This is necessary if
                    your tumour is invading your anal sphincters (the muscles at your anus). We can also
                    give you a permanent colostomy if you already have incontinence to stool (i.e., you
                    have trouble controlling your bowel movements and you have accidents) or if it is your
                    choice. Some patients choose to have a permanent colostomy because of the potential
                    negative effects on their bowel function if a re-connection is performed.</p>
                <p>This is usually done by laparoscopy or by robot. Both involve small incisions.</p>
                <p>We will remove your anus as part of this surgery and close the wound. When it is
                    all healed, then you will no longer have an anus.</p>
                <p>You will meet the stoma nurse and receive some teaching about your stoma (how
                    it works, how to change it, how to care for it, etc.) before your surgery. After your
                    surgery, you will also have regular follow-ups with the stoma nurse.</p>
                <p>It is important to remember that you do not have to restrict your activities
                    because of your stoma. We encourage you to continue all of the activities,
                    hobbies, and work that you did before your surgery even after we create your
                    stoma.</p>
                <p>There are some costs associated with a stoma. The provincial and federal
                    governments do reimburse a large part of the total costs, as well if you have
                    private insurance. Some patients may still need to spend up to $1000 to $1500
                    out of pocket to pay for stoma appliances.</p>

            <div class="content"  data-subtopic="hospital-stay">
                <h3>Hospital stay:</h3>
                <p>Patients usually stay in hospital for 2-3 days after this surgery.</p>
                <p>Recovery usually takes several weeks before you start regaining your energy.</p>
                <p>Usually patients feel almost fully recovered by 6-8 weeks after surgery.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content"  data-subtopic="surgical-risks">
                <h3>Surgical risks:</h3>
                <p>The main risk from this surgery is a wound infection of the perineal wound (i.e., the wound where your anus used to be). In about 30-50% of patients this wound may get infected or open up in the several weeks after your surgery. If this is the case, it may take weeks to months for the wound to fully heal. You are more at risk if you are a smoker, have diabetes, are immunocompromised, or if you have received radiation.</p>
                <p>About 30% of patients will have issues with their sexual and urinary function. This is because all of those nerves are exactly where we need to operate. These nerves are often too small to be seen and can be damaged during surgery.</p>

            <div class="content"  data-subtopic="cancer-outcomes">
                <h3>Cancer outcomes:</h3>
                <p>The long-term cancer outcomes will depend on the exact stage of your cancer, its
                    response to the chemotherapy and radiotherapy that you have already received, and
                    the quality of surgery. Your cancer can either come back locally (i.e., in your pelvis) or
                    as metastases (spread to other organs). The highest risk is in the first 2 years. Our team
                    will continue to follow you closely to make sure that if your cancer comes back, we
                    catch it early. Your cancer follow-ups will include blood tests, scans, and endoscopy.</p>
                    <p>Local recurrence: The risk of your cancer coming back in the same area is about
                        5-10% over the next 5 years. The highest risk is in the first 2 years. If your cancer
                        does come back in the same place, the treatment will depend on whether it has
                        also spread elsewhere, how big the recurrence is, and whether it touches any
                        surrounding organs.</p>
                        <p>Distant metastasis: Your cancer can also spread to other organs away from your
                            intestines. For rectal cancer, the most likely organs of spread are your liver,
                            lungs, and the lining of your abdomen. The risk of distant spread will depend on
                            certain tumour characteristics, the response to therapy and final pathology.
